# FlashCard_Game

The Python-based flashcard game is an interactive application designed to assist users in learning French vocabulary. The game presents users with French words and prompts them to think about their meanings. After a brief pause, the game reveals the correct translations. The interface includes two buttons at the bottom: a "Correct" button for words the user knows and a "Wrong" button for words they need to practice further. By providing immediate feedback and repetition, the game aims to enhance the user's understanding and retention of French vocabulary.

## Installation

Use the below packages to fun the application successfully. 


```python
from tkinter import *
from tkinter import messagebox
import pandas
import pandas as pd
import random
```

## Features
**Flashcard Presentation:** The game displays French words one at a time, allowing users to focus on individual terms for better comprehension.

**Time Delay:** After showing a word, the game introduces a 3-second pause, giving users an opportunity to think about the meaning before revealing the correct translation.

**Correct and Wrong Buttons:** The interface includes two buttons at the bottom. The "Correct" button indicates that the user knows the meaning of the word, while the "Wrong" button suggests they are unsure or unaware of the translation.

**Feedback and Repetition:** If the user clicks the "Wrong" button, the word will reappear in subsequent rounds to provide additional practice until the user becomes familiar with its meaning.

**Interactive User Experience:** The game offers an engaging and intuitive user interface, making it enjoyable and easy to navigate for learners of all levels.

**Vocabulary Database:** The game relies on a comprehensive database of French words and their corresponding translations. The database can be expanded and updated to ensure a wide range of vocabulary for users.

**User Progress Tracking:** The application tracks user progress, recording the number of correct and incorrect answers. This feature helps users measure their improvement over time.

**Adjustable Difficulty Levels:** The game supports different difficulty levels, catering to users with varying language proficiency. Beginners can start with basic vocabulary, while advanced learners can opt for more complex words.

**Customization Options:** Users can personalize the game by selecting specific word categories or creating their own word lists, allowing them to focus on topics or vocabulary areas of particular interest.

**Score and Leaderboard:** The application includes a scoring system that rewards users based on their accuracy and speed. Users can compete with others on a leaderboard, fostering motivation and friendly competition.
